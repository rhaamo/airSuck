Some short ISSUES log/infos

- Some planes doesn't have a lat/lon
google maps accepted creating a marker without lat/lon or null but not leaflet
but, some vehicles with lat/lon aren't trigger correctly
vehicles[vehName] seems to have lat and lon but in handleMessage it's triggered in the else { no lat / lon}
-> can't reproduce with console debugger in browser (threading issue ?)
so it spawn errors "Cannot read property 'setIcon' of null" in movePosition.
because this.marker is null / not created
my idea is that at some point the marker isn't created because of lat/lon missing.

- AIS doesn't have an icon yet

- Panel SSR click on plane row doesn't close

- Change fill colors of markers
 active blue
 selected yellow
 idle grey
